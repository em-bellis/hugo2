Interactions between hosts and their parasite or mutualist partners depend on the environment.  By altering the dynamics of symbiotic interactions, rapid global climate change impacts the health of ecosystems and human societies.

As an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jrl35/psu/index_JRL.html">Jesse Lasky's lab</a> at Penn State, I am studying genomics of local adaptation in <i>Striga hermonthica</i>, a parasitic weed that devastes yields of cereal crops including maize, sorghum, millet, and rice. Infestations are particularly severe in dry conditions and nutrient-poor soils. We are using ancient DNA from herbarium specimens to identify regions of the genome that exhibit statistical associations with environment and changes in host crop production over time.  We are integrating these genomic studies with experimental work to identify mechanisms of host resistance most sensitive to differences in abiotic environment.  More information about this project here.

Previously I studied evolution of transposable elements and their host genomes across latitudes as a Postdoctoral Research Associate with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/schaackwork/home">Sarah Schaack</a> at Reed College. My dissertation research with <a href="https://denverlab.weebly.com">Dee Denver</a> at Oregon State University focused on evolution of symbiosis specificity in <i>Aiptasia</i> sea anemones, a laboratory model system for understanding interactions between reef-building corals and the microalgae upon which they depend.
